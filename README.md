This tool enables you to classify between somatic and germline cancer cell, an predict its feature by using machine learning algorithm.

Plese execute...<br><br>
git clone https://github.com/yamamotomako/sg_predictor_ML.git<br>
cd ./script<br>
bash ./runall.sh ../sample_list.csv ../result_directory<br>

ONLY one step is required for working.<br>

Then in the result_directory (you choosen), plots(barplot, boxplot) of the basical quantities will be made, and results of the machine learning will be calculated.
